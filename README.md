This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when building Docker images: the failure to locate or correctly specify the `requirements.txt` file. The initial `Dockerfile` contains the error, while `DockerfileSolution.txt` provides the corrected version.  This error commonly arises from incorrect file paths or forgetting to include the requirements file in the Docker context.
